# Railway Deployment Steps

## Quick Fix for GitHub Pages "Failed to fetch" Error

Your GitHub Pages is failing because the backend isn't deployed yet. Follow these steps to deploy the backend to Railway:

### Step 1: Prepare for Deployment
✅ **COMPLETED** - Added gunicorn to requirements.txt
✅ **COMPLETED** - Updated Procfile to use gunicorn for production
✅ **COMPLETED** - Backend is ready for deployment

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

1. **Go to Railway**: Visit https://railway.app

2. **Sign up/Login**: Use your GitHub account to sign up or login

3. **Create New Project**: 
   - Click "New Project" button
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"

4. **Connect GitHub**: 
   - If prompted, authorize Railway to access your GitHub
   - Search for your repository: `gods-health-ai` (or whatever your repo is named)
   - Select the repository

5. **Configure Deployment**:
   - Click "Add Variables" (optional) or "Deploy Now"
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Python app
   - The build will start automatically

6. **Generate Domain**:
   - Once deployed, go to your service settings
   - Click "Generate Domain" to get a public URL
   - Copy this URL (it will look like: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`)

### Step 3: Update Frontend Configuration

Once you get the Railway URL, update the frontend:

1. Open `frontend/.env.production`
2. Replace the placeholder URL with your actual Railway URL:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://your-actual-railway-url.up.railway.app
   ```

### Step 4: Redeploy GitHub Pages

1. Commit and push the updated `.env.production` file
2. GitHub Actions will automatically rebuild and deploy your frontend
3. Wait for the deployment to complete
4. Test your GitHub Pages URL again

### Expected Result

After completing these steps:
- ✅ Backend will be running on Railway
- ✅ Frontend will connect to the deployed backend
- ✅ GitHub Pages will work without "Failed to fetch" errors
- ✅ All predictors will function properly

### Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check Railway build logs for errors
2. Ensure all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
3. Verify the Procfile syntax is correct
4. Check that Flask app runs locally first

### Files Modified for Railway Deployment

- `backend/requirements.txt` - Added gunicorn
- `Procfile` - Updated to use gunicorn with proper port binding
- `backend/app.py` - Already configured for production (PORT env var)

**Next Step**: Please follow Step 2 above to deploy to Railway, then let me know the Railway URL so I can update the frontend configuration.
